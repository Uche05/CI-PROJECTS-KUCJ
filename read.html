            <h3>Brief Overview of AI.</h3>
            To the best of people's knowledge a computer does things it has been explicitly told to do or programmed to
            do. However, that is not the case with Artificial Intelligence, or AI. AI is the tech that allows computers
            perform tasks as a human would, without any explicit programming. It's simply the act of giving a computer a
            literal "brain". For this to be done, several other technologies and algorithms have to be implemented to
            actually achieve this goal, including: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and
            others are otherwise called the subsets of Artificial Intelligence.

            <details>
                "Automation is the application of technology, programs, robotics or processes to achieve outcomes with
                minimal human input." [From <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">here</a> -IBM Learn 2024 ]
                In other words, Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention.
                This
                does mean that automation does use predefined rules and programming to handle and perform tasks
                efficiently
                and repeatedly. Automation is mostly sought after to perform repetitive/overwhelming tasks. It is a
                handy
                tool in most digital workers' toolbelts. So, can automation implement AI to perform tasks? That would be
                a
                game-changer such as the new Devon AI tool announced - it is possible to make automation more AI-centric
                as
                it would bring actual use of intelligence rather reliance on pre-defined rules.

            <h4>Most commonly interchangeably used terms in the field of AI.</h4>

            <details> While technically different, these terms are often used interchangeably to describe the
                mathematical process or structure used for AI tasks. An algorithm is the process or method, and a model
                is the output or result of that process, typically used in AI tasks like prediction, classification, or
                decision-making.
                <summary>Algorithm vs. Model</summary>

            <details> Machine Learning involves algorithms that parse data, learn from that data, and then apply what
                they have learned to make informed decisions while Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses layered
                neural networks to analyze various factors of data. Deep learning is particularly powerful for tasks
                like image and speech recognition.

            <details> Neural Networks generally refer to systems loosely modeled after the human brain that are designed
                to recognize patterns.
                Artificial Neural Networks are a specific type of neural network used in computing, which are key
                components in deep learning designs.

                process is exploratory.
                Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It uses methods
                from neural networks, statistics, operations research, and physics to find hidden insights in data
                without explicitly being programmed for where to look or what to conclude.

            <details> Cognitive Computing refers to systems that mimic human interaction by interpreting speech and
                text, and responding in a human-like manner.
                AI encompasses a wider array of technologies including those used in cognitive computing but also
                includes systems that can perform tasks without necessarily mimicking human behavior.

            <details> AI involves creating algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human
                intelligence.
                Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and
                application of robots. When robots are equipped with AI, they can perform tasks that involve a degree of
                autonomous decision-making. Robot and AI: While a robot is a physical machine, it often incorporates AI
                to perform tasks autonomously, blurring the lines between the two terms.

            <details> Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a type of software automation that mimics actions that humans
                might take, like logging into applications, entering data, completing tasks, and logging out. RPA is
                typically rule-based and does not learn from its actions.
                AI includes systems that can learn and adapt over time, improving their decision-making capabilities
                based on experiences or newly acquired data.

                analysis to drive business decisions.
                AI involves more dynamic analysis capabilities, including predictive analytics and machine learning,
                where the system improves its analysis over time through learning.

                Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves teaching a computer to learn from data and make
                decisions based on its learning, without being explicitly programmed. It is often used within predictive
                analytics but is broader in application and capability.

            <h3 id="ml">AI's subsets- ML</h3>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing
            algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks over
            time, without being explicitly programmed for each task. The key idea is that the machine uses patterns and
            insights derived from data to make predictions, decisions, or recognize patterns. ML is where AI gets its
            capabilities from.

            <h4>Here are key concepts of Machine Learning</h4>

            <details> This involves training a model on a labelled dataset, where the input data is paired with the
                correct output. The model learns to predict the output from new, unseen inputs.
                <summary>Supervised Learning</summary>
            </details>
            <details> The model learns from unlabelled data, identifying patterns, groupings, or structures within the
                data without explicit instructions on what to predict.
                <summary>Unsupervised Learning</summary>
            </details>
            <details>The model (often called an agent) learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback
                in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a strategy that maximizes the cumulative
                reward.
                <summary> Reinforcement Learning</summary>
            </details>
            <details> This combines a small amount of labelled data with a large amount of unlabelled data. This
                approach is used when labelling data is expensive or time-consuming.
                For example; text classification, where only a few documents are labelled, but the model learns to
                classify a large number of documents.
                <summary>Semi-supervised Learning</summary>
            </details>
            <details> Involves taking a pre-trained model developed for one task and applying it to a different but
                related task. This approach leverages existing knowledge to improve performance on a new task.
                For example: using a model trained on a large dataset of images to help classify medical images.
                <summary>Transfer Learning</summary>
            </details>
            <details> This is a very specialized subset of ML <a href="#ml">(Machine Learning)</a> that uses
                multi-layered artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model complex patterns in large datasets. Deep
                learning models excel at tasks like image and speech recognition.
                Example: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification or Recurrent Neural Networks
                (RNNs) for sequence data like text or time series.
                <summary>Deep Learning</summary>
            </details>
            <details>These are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected
                nodes (neurons). ANNs are the foundation of deep learning and can learn to approximate complex functions
                by adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons.
                A simple ANN could be used for binary classification, while deeper, more complex ANNs are used in deep
                learning.
