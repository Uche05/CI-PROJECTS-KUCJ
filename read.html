            <h3>Brief Overview of AI.</h3>
            To the best of people's knowledge a computer does things it has been explicitly told to do or programmed to
            do. However, that is not the case with Artificial Intelligence, or AI. AI is the tech that allows computers
            perform tasks as a human would, without any explicit programming. It's simply the act of giving a computer a
            literal "brain". For this to be done, several other technologies and algorithms have to be implemented to
            actually achieve this goal, including: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and
            others are otherwise called the subsets of Artificial Intelligence.

                </summary>
                <p>"Automation is the application of technology, programs, robotics or processes to achieve outcomes
                    with
                    minimal human input." [From <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation" target="_blank">here</a>
                    -IBM Learn 2024.
                    In other words, Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks without human
                    intervention.
                    This
                    does mean that automation does use predefined rules and programming to handle and perform tasks
                    efficiently
                    and repeatedly. Automation is mostly sought after to perform repetitive/overwhelming tasks. It is a
                    handy
                    tool in most digital workers' toolbelts. So, can automation implement AI to perform tasks? That
                    would be
                    a
                    game-changer such as the new Devon AI tool announced - it is possible to make automation more
                    AI-centric
                    as
                    it would actual use of intelligence rather reliance on pre-defined rules. </p>

                    mathematical process or structure used for AI tasks. An algorithm is the process or method, and a
                    model
                    is the output or result of that process, typically used in AI tasks like prediction, classification,

            <h3 id="ml">AI's subsets- ML</h3>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing
            algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks over
            time, without being explicitly programmed for each task. The key idea is that the machine uses patterns and
            insights derived from data to make predictions, decisions, or recognize patterns. ML is where AI gets its
            capabilities from.

            <h4>Here are key concepts of Machine Learning</h4>

            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Supervised Learning </span>
                </summary>
                <p> This involves training a model on a labelled dataset, where the input data is paired with the
                    correct output. The model learns to predict the output from new, unseen inputs.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Unsupervised Learning </span>
                </summary>
                <p> The model learns from unlabelled data, identifying patterns, groupings, or structures within the
                    data without explicit instructions on what to predict.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span> Reinforcement Learning </span>
                </summary>
                <p>The model (often called an agent) learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback
                    in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a strategy that maximizes the cumulative
                    reward.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Semi-supervised Learning </span>
                </summary>
                <p> This combines a small amount of labelled data with a large amount of unlabelled data. This
                    approach is used when labelling data is expensive or time-consuming.
                    For example; text classification, where only a few documents are labelled, but the model learns to
                    classify a large number of documents.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Transfer Learning </span>
                </summary>
                <p> Involves taking a pre-trained model developed for one task and applying it to a different but
                    related task. This approach leverages existing knowledge to improve performance on a new task.
                    For example: using a model trained on a large dataset of images to help classify medical images.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Deep Learning </span>
                </summary>
                <p> This is a very specialized subset of ML <a href="#ml">(Machine Learning)</a> that uses
                    multi-layered artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model complex patterns in large datasets. Deep
                    learning models excel at tasks like image and speech recognition.
                    Example: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification or Recurrent Neural Networks
                    (RNNs) for sequence data like text or time series.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</span>
                </summary>
                <p>These are computational models inspired by the human ain, consisting of layers of interconnected
                    nodes (neurons). ANNs are the foundation of deep learning and can learn to approximate complex
                    functions
                    by adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons.
                    A simple ANN could be used for binary classification, while deeper, more complex ANNs are used in
                    deep
                    learning.

                    enabling
                    AI to make informed decisions using knowledge bases and ontologies. This goal has been achieved by
                    certain AI models such as ChatGPT by OpenAI, Gemini, formally Google Bard by Google LLC and
                    Microsoft Co-pilot by Microsoft.</p>
                <p>Planning and Decision-Making: Equip AI agents with the ability to plan actions and make decisions
                    that
                    achieve goals or optimize outcomes, even under uncertain conditions.</p>
                <p>Learning: Design systems that can learn from data, improving their performance over time through
                    various
                    forms of machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.</p>
                <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enable machines to understand, generate, and interact using human
                    language, tackling tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation.</p>
                <p>Perception: Develop AI that can perceive and interpret sensory inputs, such as vision, sound, and
                    touch,
                    to understand and interact with the physical world.</p>
                <p>Social Intelligence: Create AI systems that recognize and simulate human emotions, facilitating
                    socially intelligent interactions that are more engaging and human-like.</p>
                <p>General Intelligence: Pursue the long-term goal of developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
                    capable of performing a wide range of tasks with the versatility and breadth of human intelligence.
                    In other words, the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least
                    equal level—is among the field's long-term goals.</p>

            <h3>Understanding ML</h3>
            <h4>Machine Learning algorithms</h4>
            <h5>Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are fundamental to the field of artificial intelligence, providing the
                means through which computers can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
                <strong>
                    The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data available, the specific task at hand, and the
                    desired outcome.
                </strong>
            </h5>

            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span> How Machine Learning Algorithms Are Used</span>
                </summary>
                <p>- Feature Selection and Engineering: Before applying machine learning algorithms, significant effort
                    goes into
                    selecting the appropriate features (input variables) that make the most sense for the model to learn
                    effectively.
                    - Model Training: Algorithms learn from data by adjusting their parameters to minimize error between
                    their
                    predictions and the actual outcomes of the data.
                    - Model Evaluation: After training, models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision,
                    recall, and F1
                    score for classification tasks, or mean squared error for regression tasks.
                    - Model Optimization: Techniques such as grid search or random search are used to find the optimal
                    settings for the
                    model’s parameters to improve performance.
                    - Prediction: Once trained and validated, models are used to predict outcomes on new, unseen data.
                </p>
            </details>

            <h4>Types of Machine Learning Algorithms </h4>

            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Supervised Machine Learning Models</span>
                </summary>
                <p>
                    These algorithms are trained using labelled data, i.e., data which has an input paired with the
                    correct output. The algorithm learns a model on this data to be able to predict the output
                    associated with new inputs.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Unsupervised Machine Learning Models</span>
                </summary>
                <p>
                    These algorithms are used when the data has no labels, and the goal is to infer the natural
                    structure present within a set of data points.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Semi-supervised Machine Learning Models</span>
                </summary>
                <p>
                    Combines a small amount of labelled data with a large amount of unlabelled data during training.
                    Semi-supervised learning is useful when the cost of labelling data is too high.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <span>Reinforcement Machine Learning Models</span>
                </summary>
                <p>
                    In this type of ML, the algorithm learns to make specific decisions by trying to maximize a reward
                    signal. The learner is not told which actions to take but instead must discover which actions yield
                    the most reward by trying them.

            <h3>Understanding ChatGPT and other LLMs</h3>
            <h4>To be able to know as stated we'll explain how ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI based
                on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture's components/features are.</h4>

            <dl>
                <dt>It's Core</dt>
                <dd>ChatGPT is built on a neural network architecture known as a transformer(this concept was introduced
                    on a paper, “Attention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. in 2017), which is particularly
                    effective for processing and generating natural language. They use self-attention mechanisms to
                    produce input data. It involves
                    weighing the importance of each word in a sentence, regardless of their position to enable it
                    understand the context and relationships between words in a sentence.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
                <dt>The Training Process</dt>
                <dd>This consists of <strong>pre-training</strong> where GPT models undergo a phase of pre-training
                    where they learn from
                    a vast tanks of text data using unsupervised learning as GPT models are typically trained using a
                    variant of language modelling, specifically predicting the next word in a sequence given the
                    previous
                    words (autoregressive language modelling). This helps the model learn a broad understanding of
                    language, including grammar, facts, and various language styles and semantics.
                    After pre-training, the model can be fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.
                    This stage tailors the model’s general capabilities to particular applications such as answering
                    questions, translating text, or generating content. Supervised Learning is used in
                    <strong>fine-tuning</strong>,
                    the model might use labelled data specific to a task, adjusting its parameters to minimize error
                    and optimize performance for that task.
                </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
                <dt>Structural components</dt>
                <dd>- Multi-Head Attention (Layers and heads): Each layer has multiple 'heads' in its attention
                    mechanisms, allowing the model to simultaneously focus on different parts of the input sequence for
                    better context understanding.
                    - Feed-Forward Neural Networks: Each layer also includes feed-forward neural networks that process
                    the outputs from the attention mechanisms.
                    - Normalization and Residual Connections: These are used in each layer to help stabilize the
                    learning process and improve the flow of gradients through the network during training.
                    - Input Embeddings: Words are converted into numerical form to be processed by the model. Each word
                    is represented by a unique vector in a high-dimensional space.
                    - Positional Encoding: Since transformers do not inherently process the order of the input (unlike
                    RNNs), positional encodings are added to give the model information about the position of words in
                    the input sequence.

            </dl>

            <dl>
                <dt>Decoding strategies for text generation</dt>
                <dd>When generating text, GPT uses various strategies to decide which word to produce next:
                    - Greedy Decoding: Always picks the most likely next word.
                    - Beam Search: Considers multiple possible sequences simultaneously, choosing the sequence that has
                    the overall
                    highest probability.
                    - Top-K Sampling: Randomly picks the next word from the top K likely candidates, balancing
                    creativity and accuracy.

                <summary>
                    <span> Advice for AI Developers </span>
                </summary>

                <p>1. Embed Ethics from the Start:
                    Ethics should be integrated into every stage of AI development, from conceptualization and design to
                    deployment and maintenance. Consider the potential ethical implications of your AI system before
                    writing the first line of code.</p>

                <p>2. Perform Regular Audits and Bias Testing:
                    Regularly audit AI systems for fairness, accuracy, and bias. Use diverse datasets and conduct tests
                    to ensure that your system does not disproportionately disadvantage any group.</p>

                <p>3. Prioritize User Consent and Data Privacy:
                    Always obtain informed consent from users before collecting their data. Implement strong data
                    encryption and anonymization techniques to protect user privacy.</p>

                <p>4. Design for Transparency:
                    Make your AI models as transparent as possible. Provide users with explanations of how decisions are
                    made and ensure that your system’s operations are understandable, especially when the AI impacts
                    critical decisions.</p>

                <p>5. Ensure Robustness and Security:
                    Build AI systems that are robust and resilient to attacks or failures. Implement security measures
                    to protect the system from hacking and unauthorized use.</p>

                <p>6. Foster a Collaborative Ethical Culture:
                    Encourage open discussions about ethics within your team and organization. Foster a culture where
                    ethical concerns can be raised without fear of retribution, and where continuous learning about AI
                    ethics is encouraged.</p>

                <p>7. Engage with Stakeholders:
                    Engage with a diverse group of stakeholders, including ethicists, legal experts, users, and affected
                    communities, to gather input on potential ethical issues. This helps ensure that the AI system
                    aligns with broader societal values.</p>

                <p>8. Prepare for Accountability:
                    Establish clear lines of accountability for AI systems. Have processes in place to address and
                    rectify any negative impacts or errors that arise from the AI’s deployment.</p>

                <p>9. Stay Informed on Legal and Ethical Standards:
                    AI ethics is a rapidly evolving field. Stay informed about the latest legal requirements, ethical
                    standards, and best practices in AI development. Engage with the broader AI ethics community to keep
                    up with emerging issues.</p>
